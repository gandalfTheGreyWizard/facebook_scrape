That's a golden goose that would pay dividends for decades.  \n\nThe power to tamper with the US Presidential election would be greater than the acquisition of the Enigma Machine during WWII.  Even then, when the Allies got their hands on the Enigma Machine and finally broke the code, they did NOTHING that would've otherwise tipped off the Germans that they could read their messages.  Why?  Because the Germans would've changed the codes and render all that Allied effort meaningless.\n\nThat same principle applies here.  \n\nTampering with the US presidential election would be the holy grail of all powers of espionage.  Do you really think the Russians would compromise such a thing by using Russian Military personnel and hacking tools that would leave a broad and visible trail of evidence straight back to Moscow?  \n\nPutin is a former Lt. Colonel in the KGB who came up through the ranks during the Cold War.  If Russia had such an ability as to hack or tamper with the US elections, he would never allow Russian personnel to handle such an operation yet alone, conduct that operation from Russian soil.\n\nBasic operational requirements would demand that non Russian personnel carry out the operation far away from Russian soil if for no other reason than to preserve plausible deniability and more importantly, to preserve their continued ability to manipulate the elections in the event the operation failed or was compromised.  \n\nThese Russian Military officers will never be tried and Mueller knows that.  The only value such meaningless indictments will have is the vapid left will automatically equate the indictments with a trial verdict of guilty so they can claim some sort of victory.  \n\nThis investigation will magically conclude after the elections in November.  \n\nAs an aside, ask yourself \,body:{text:""Please explain how hacking someone's email account is supposed to result in winning the elections...\nThey should have known not to watch porn in the office, anyway.,body:{text:""Thanks so much!
